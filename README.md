# script.idolpx.installer
Private Kodi build installer/updater<br>

The main functionality is working.  There are some features that still need to be completed.<br>

## Kodi Addon Setup

1. Edit the "update_url" and "adultpin" setting in "resources/settings.xml" to match your domain where you host the server scripts
2. Edit "resources/nsfw_addons.dat" to match the list of "Adult" addons to Show/Hide through the Settings menu
3. Zip addon (Make sure the top level folder "script.idolpx.installer" is in the zip and the addon files are inside it.)
4. Install addon in Kodi with "Install from zip file" option
5. Configure all of your other addons the way you want them
6. Go to the "idolpx Installer" settings (Advanced) then select "Backup Current Configuration"
7. When the backup is complete, the archive will be in your Kodi data folder with a matching '.md5' file
8. Upload the ".zip" and ".zip.md5" file to the "kodi" folder on your server
9. Edit the "version.php" file in the "kodi" folder on your server to match the archive name ~~and set the "_md5" value that is contained in the matching ".md5" file~~ (Addon will look for .md5 file on server now instead of using JSON data)
<br>
You can have a current config and a test config on the server.  If the "Select Test Configuration" option is set in the addon then it will use the test config specified in the "version.php" file.  That way you can check everything out before promoting it to the current config.
